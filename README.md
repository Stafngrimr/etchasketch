Project for TOP

It's working!

Normal pen mode, Rainbow mode, a CLEAR button and the functionality to change the size of the grid is all in place and it looks cool. The painting works on hover, not on click, and I still need to add in the "shadowMode" where dragging the mouse over makes the grid darker until black, not just straight change the colour.
